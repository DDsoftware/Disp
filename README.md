Disp provides users with a profile page where the user will be directed to upon signing in. 
Disp will be available for visitors to browse listings and apply for an account.
An administrator (Super-user) can accept or reject a visitor application to become a user.
The system will use a database to store users information and the inventories. HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript would be used to develop Disp.

Summary:

Right now, it is not fully contional because we didn't have enough time 
to implement the transaction. 

We also had a little bit of integration problem
because one guy write java code however the program is in javascript. 

Also, one team member was suppose to work on the product page however, he didn't do anything.

Another reason why we didn't finished on time is because we made a bad choice of database system.
We chose Postgres which is hard work with. And, we also spend sometime trying to normalize our database.
